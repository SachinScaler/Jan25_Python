   - **Core Usecase**: Ensures a solid understanding of Python fundamentals, providing the foundation for more advanced topics.
   - **Applications**: Basic scripting, automation tasks, and simple data processing.

### Python Refresher 2
   - **Summary**: A continuation of the Python refresher, focusing on data structure topics such as Dictionary, set, lists and memory management
   - **Core Usecase**: Prepares learners to work with modular, reusable code and understand advanced Python features for clean and efficient programming.
   - **Applications**: Efficiently storing data into appropriate data structure

### Basics of Time & Space Complexity
   - **Summary**: This notebook introduces the fundamental concepts of time and space complexity. It covers how to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms using Big O notation, and discusses various scenarios, along with space vs. time trade-offs.
   - **Core Usecase**: Helps in analyzing and optimizing algorithms for performance, especially in time-critical applications.
   - **Applications**: Algorithm optimization in data processing, machine learning, and system design.

### OOP 1 - Introduction
   - **Summary**: An introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The notebook covers key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.
   - **Core Usecase**: Organizes code into reusable objects and classes, making large projects more manageable and scalable.
   - **Applications**: Software development, game development, web applications, and systems that require complex data modeling.

### OOP 2 - Dunders, Inheritance
   - **Summary**: A deeper dive into OOP, this notebook explores special methods (dunders) and the concept of inheritance. It provides insights into creating complex and hierarchical class structures.
   - **Core Usecase**: Enables more advanced object-oriented designs through inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of special methods for custom object behavior.
   - **Applications**: Creating frameworks, building complex software systems, and designing reusable codebases.

### Functional Programming 1 - Basics
   - **Summary**: An introduction to functional programming in Python. Concepts such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and immutability are discussed.
   - **Core Usecase**: Encourages writing cleaner, more maintainable code with functions as first-class citizens and immutable data structures.
   - **Applications**: Data transformation, parallel computing, and functional reactive programming.

### Functional Programming 2 - Advanced Topics
   - **Summary**: A deeper exploration of functional programming in Python, covering advanced concepts such as map, filter, reduce, and functional data structures.
   - **Core Usecase**: Helps solve problems with functional constructs, improving readability and conciseness, while ensuring immutability and side-effect-free code.
   - **Applications**: Data pipelines, functional programming frameworks, and large-scale data processing tasks.

### Exception Handling
   - **Summary**: This notebook explores Python's exception handling mechanisms. Topics covered include try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices for writing robust Python code.
   - **Core Usecase**: Teaches the best practices for handling errors in Python applications, ensuring smooth user experiences and system reliability.
   - **Applications**: Developing robust APIs, handling runtime errors in applications, and building fault-tolerant systems.

### File Handling
   - **Summary**: This repository also demonstrates how to handle files in Python. Youâ€™ll find examples of reading and writing to text and CSV files, handling file paths, and working with file I/O operations.
   - **Core Usecase**: Teaches essential skills for working with files, including reading from and writing to text, CSV, and JSON files, as well as handling large datasets.
   - **Applications**: Data analysis, log file processing, building custom file-based data storage systems, and automating file handling tasks.
